## Note

This software will get no versioning and lives on the bloody main branch.

## Development

For development there is a little script in the project root named `start_dev_env.sh`.
Executing it as well as `.gradlew backend:bootRun` (from project root) and `npm run dev` (from the `frontend` folder)
will set up the local environment on http://localhost:8888.
